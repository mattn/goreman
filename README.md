The goal of this refactor is to add more ways to customize that are not possible in a pure Procfile

- Set port
- Enable / disable config entry
- Configure / log environment



# Goreman

Clone of foreman written in golang.

https://github.com/ddollar/foreman

## Getting Started

## Usage

    goreman start

Will start all commands defined in the `Procfile` and display their outputs.
Any signals are forwarded to each process.

## Example

## Design

The main goroutine loads `Procfile` and starts each command in the file. Afterwards, it is driven by the following two kinds of events, and then take proper action against the managed processes.

1. It receives a signal, which could be one of `SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`, and `SIGHUP`;
2. It receives an RPC call, which is triggered by the command `goreman run COMMAND [PROCESS...]`.
